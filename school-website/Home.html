					<div class="text"><p>Bangladesh has made remarkable gains over the past two decades by ensuring access to education, especially at the primary level and for girls. The country’s net enrollment rate at the primary school level increased from 80 percent in 2000 to 98 percent in 2015, and secondary school net enrollment is now around 54 percent, up from 45 percent in 2000. Furthermore, the percentage of children completing primary school is close to 80 percent, and Bangladesh has achieved gender parity in access, in addition to dramatic decreases in disparities between the highest and lowest consumption quintiles at both the primary and secondary levels.<br><br><strong>Statement of the problem</strong></p>
					
					<p>Training makes a man competent to do a job. Training is a systematic process. Teacher training is to learn how to conduct teaching on the basis of fixed objectives, following appropriate techniques. By training can successfully run his / her teaching learning according to curriculum and syllabus. At the same time one can gain experience how to evaluate a lesson. Not only that training also provides leadership quality and personality, which are necessary for professional improvement. In a nutshell there is no alternative of training for a good teacher. Training is essential for quality education. In this backdrop, to study the present teacher training system of PE is very much logical.</p></div>

						<h2 style="color:green";>Literature Review</h2>
						<p>It is not an easy task to prepare a term paper A Study on “Training system for teachers of primary education in Bangladesh: I depended much on some literatures available at NAEM library to find guidelines. Training manual for primary level subject teachers curriculum and syllabus of C-in-ED courses helped me much in this regard. Few other literatures like “Management of Education” and “Dictionary of Primary Education” were also very helpful for this research.</P>
						<P>Despite inability to collect relevant data and information regarding PE training system I had to explore both formal and informal sources of dependable information in for of formal areas of information I have consulted different reports on training manuals and other papers, specially reports on training, articles on training and some have magazines helped me enormously.</P>
